I am trying to make a very small bookmarking app. 
I am modifying this TODO app I found using AngularJS 
(http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/active) .
My goal right now is to have the user be able to enter into two boxes. 
The first box is the title of their URL (Such as "Facebook") and the second box 
is the copy and pasted URL (Such as "www.facebook.com/blahblahblah"). 
When they put this into the bookmark manager, it will only display their custom title, 
but it will be clickable and it will go to the actual URL that they pasted. 
If you think you can quickly help me do this, please let me know. Thanks! Any tips appreciated!



<a href="www.facebook.com/blahblahblah">Facebook</a>

It will show "Facebook" on the screen but it will be clikable
and will lead to "www.facebook.com/blahblahblah
